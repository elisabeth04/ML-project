a&e networks (stylized as a+e networks) is an american multinational broadcasting company that is a 50–50 joint venture between hearst communications and the walt disney company through its general entertainment content division. the company owns several non-fiction and entertainment-based television brands, including its namesake a&e, history, lifetime, fyi, and their associated sister channels, and holds stakes in or licenses their international branches.


== history ==
a&e was formed from the merger of the alpha repertory television service and the entertainment channel, a premium cable channel, in 1984 with their respective owners keeping stakes in the new company. thus a&e's shareholders were hearst and abc (from arts) and radio city music hall (rockefeller group) and rca, then the parent of nbc (from entertainment channel). the company launched arts & entertainment network, a cultural cable channel, on february 1, 1984.in 1990, after having aired episodes of its original 1960's version starting in 1987, a&e acquired rights to, and started producing new episodes of, the documentary series biography— which became the channel's flagship program. the network also introduced its own companion magazine a&e monthly.the company indicated that plans for a history channel were in the works in 1993; it purchased the lou reda productions documentary library and long-term rights for the hearst entertainment documentaries archive. in june 1993, the rockefeller group's radio city music hall sold its 12.5% stake in a&e to the other three partners (now including nbc in place of rca after ge's purchase of the latter in 1986) with nbc owning 25% and the other two 37.5% each. also that month, a new production unit was set up.
