f5's customers include microsoft, oracle, alaska airlines, tesla, and meta.

=== f5 big-ip ===
f5's big-ip product family comprises hardware, modularized software, and virtual appliances that run the f5 tmos operating system.  depending on the appliance selected, one or more big-ip product modules can be added.
offerings include:

big-ip local traffic manager (ltm): local load balancing with caching, compression and tcp acceleration, based on a full-proxy architecture.
big-ip dns: an intelligent global site load balancing (gslb) and authoritative dns server. distributes dns and application requests based on user, network, and cloud performance conditions.
big-ip advanced firewall manager (afm): on-premises ddos protection and data center firewall .
big-ip access policy manager (apm): provides access control and authentication for http and https applications.
advanced waf: an advanced web application firewall with cutting-edge technology.
container ingress service (cis): provides automation, orchestration, and networking services for container deployments.
ip intelligence (ipi): blocking known bad ip addresses, prevention of phishing attacks and botnets.
big-iq: a framework for managing big-ip devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). big-iq supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a set of open restful apis. big-iq uses a multi-tenant approach to management. this allows organizations to move closer to it as a service without concern that it might affect the stability or security of the services fabric.[24]


==== big-ip history ====
on september 7, 2004, f5 networks released version 9.0 of the big-ip software in addition to appliances to run the software. version 9.0 also marked the introduction of the company's tmos architecture, with enhancements including:

moved from bsd to linux to handle system management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.)
creation of a traffic management microkernel (tmm) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities.
creation of the standard full-proxy mode, which fully terminates network connections at the big-ip and establishes new connections between the big-ip and the member servers in a pool. this allows for optimum tcp stacks on both sides as well as the complete ability to modify traffic in either direction.in late 2021, f5 introduced the next-generation of their big-ip hardware platforms, the rseries and velos chassis platform. these next-generation systems will replace the previous generation iseries and viprion chassis system.
