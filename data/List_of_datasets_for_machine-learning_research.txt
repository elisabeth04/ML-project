these datasets are applied for machine learning research and have been cited in peer-reviewed academic journals. datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms (such as deep learning), computer hardware, and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets. high-quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce.


== image data ==
datasets consisting primarily of images or videos for tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and multi-label classification.

== question answering data ==
this section includes datasets that deals with structured data.


== multivariate data ==
datasets consisting of rows of observations and columns of attributes characterizing those observations. typically used for regression analysis or classification but other types of algorithms can also be used. this section includes datasets that do not fit in the above categories.

== curated repositories of datasets ==
as datasets come in myriad formats and can sometimes be difficult to use, there has been considerable work put into curating and standardizing the format of datasets to make them easier to use for machine learning research.

openml: web platform with python, r, java, and other apis for downloading hundreds of machine learning datasets, evaluating algorithms on datasets, and benchmarking algorithm performance against dozens of other algorithms.
pmlb: a large, curated repository of benchmark datasets for evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms. provides classification and regression datasets in a standardized format that are accessible through a python api.
metatext nlp: https://metatext.io/datasets web repository maintained by community, containing nearly 1000 benchmark datasets, and counting. provides many tasks from classification to qa, and various languages from english, portuguese to arabic.
appen: off the shelf and open source datasets hosted and maintained by the company. these biological, image, physical, question answering, signal, sound, text, and video resources number over 250 and can be applied to over 25 different use cases.
